## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| 3-phase structure | Quick depth setting; natural grouping of fixes → content → polish | 2026-01-23 |
| Group all info pages in Phase 2 | 6 pages share similar work pattern (layout redesign), efficient to batch | 2026-01-23 |
| Animations as final phase | Polish layer requires stable foundation from Phases 1-2 | 2026-01-23 |

### Key Context

**Codebase:**
- Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript
- Located in `tools-shop/` subdirectory
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- All UI in Bulgarian

**Current State:**
- Core e-commerce works (products, cart, checkout, admin)
- Search broken, info pages are text-only placeholders
- No animations currently

**Constraints:**
- UI/UX fixes only, no backend restructuring
- Maintain existing visual design language
- Must use existing Next.js + Tailwind stack

---

## Todos

### Immediate Next Steps

- [ ] Run `/gsd:plan-phase 1` to create execution plan for Critical Fixes
- [ ] Review Phase 1 plan before execution
- [ ] Execute Phase 1 plan

### Future Work

- [ ] Phase 2: Info Pages redesign
- [ ] Phase 3: Animation & Polish

## Blockers

**Current:** None

**Resolved:** None yet

---

## Session Continuity

**What just happened:**
- Roadmap created with 3 phases
- All 18 v1 requirements mapped to phases
- Success criteria derived for each phase
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability updated

**What's next:**
- Create execution plan for Phase 1 (6 requirements: fixes + navigation)
- Begin implementation after plan approval

**Context for next agent:**
- Phase 1 focuses on critical user-facing issues (broken search, unwanted elements)
- All work happens in `tools-shop/` subdirectory
- Mode is YOLO (plan check disabled), but verifier enabled
- Bulgarian language site — preserve all existing text
