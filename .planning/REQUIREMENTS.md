## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| New features (accounts, notifications) | Focus is on fixes and polish only |
| Backend restructuring | Frontend/UI work only |
| Mobile app | Web only |
| Payment integration changes | Existing flow stays |
| Cookie consent banner | Keep existing, only improve policy page |
