<objective>
Verify all Phase 3 features work correctly with human visual inspection.

Purpose: Animation quality cannot be fully verified programmatically. Human verification ensures the landing page feels polished and professional.

Output: User-approved landing page with all animations functioning.

  <name>Task 1: Start dev server and run automated checks</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run automated verification before human inspection:

```bash
cd tools-shop

# Build check
npm run build

# TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Start dev server in background
npm run dev
```

Check for:
- No build errors
- No TypeScript errors
- Dev server starts on localhost:3000

Also verify all new files exist:
```bash
ls src/hooks/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts
ls src/components/AnimatedSection.tsx
ls src/components/HeroBlobs.tsx
ls src/components/FloatingIcons.tsx
ls src/components/StatsBar.tsx
ls src/components/WhyUsSection.tsx
ls src/components/TestimonialsSection.tsx
ls src/components/BrandPartners.tsx
ls src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx
```

Check CSS has all animation keyframes:
```bash
grep -E "(blob-morph|pulse-badge)" src/app/globals.css
```
  </action>
  <verify>
- npm run build succeeds
- All 9 new component/hook files exist
- globals.css has animation keyframes
- Dev server running without errors
  </verify>
  <done>Build passes, TypeScript passes, dev server running, all files present.</done>

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser

2. **Hero Section Check:**
   - [ ] Gradient blobs visible behind hero content (subtle moving shapes)

   - [ ] Both blend naturally with existing hero design

3. **Stats Bar Check:**
   - [ ] Scroll down to see stats bar (dark background)
   - [ ] Numbers animate from 0 to target when entering view
   - [ ] Shows: 5000+ клиенти, 350+ продукта, 98% доволни

4. **Why Us Section Check:**
   - [ ] 3 cards visible: Оригинални продукти, Бърза доставка, Експертна подкрепа

   - [ ] Cards have hover effect (lift + border glow)

5. **Testimonials Check:**
   - [ ] 3 customer reviews visible with star ratings
   - [ ] Avatar shows first letter of name

8. **Product Cards Check:**
   - [ ] Hover on any product card - see pronounced lift effect
   - [ ] Quick view buttons slide in from below
   - [ ] Sale badges have subtle pulse animation

9. **Reduced Motion Check (optional):**
   - Open DevTools > Rendering > Emulate "prefers-reduced-motion: reduce"
   - [ ] Blobs disappear
   - [ ] Animations still work but are instant (no duration)

10. **Mobile Check:**
    - Resize browser to mobile width
    - [ ] All sections stack vertically
    - [ ] Stats bar shows single column
    - [ ] Countdown timer fits on small screens
  </how-to-verify>

  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if everything looks good.

If issues found, describe what's wrong:
- "hero blobs too prominent" - will reduce opacity
- "stats not animating" - will check ScrollSpy
- "cards not lifting on hover" - will check CSS
- etc.
