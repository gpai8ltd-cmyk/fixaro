<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign /cookies page with category toggles + enhanced table</name>
  <files>tools-shop/src/app/cookies/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Transform the cookies page with visual category toggles and improved table:

1. Convert to client component ('use client') for toggle interactivity

2. Redesign cookie category cards as toggleable sections:
   - Replace the 4 existing category cards with toggle-style cards
   - Each category (Mandatory, Functional, Analytics, Marketing) gets:
     * Visual toggle switch on the right side
     * Toggle is always ON for Mandatory (disabled, grayed)
     * Other toggles default to OFF, clickable
     * When toggled ON: card has active styling (green border/bg)
     * When toggled OFF: card is muted/gray
   - Keep category description and cookie list inside each card
   - Add icon for each category (Shield, Settings, BarChart3, Megaphone)

3. Create custom toggle component inline:
   - Rounded pill shape: `w-12 h-6 rounded-full`
   - ON state: green background with white circle on right
   - OFF state: gray background with white circle on left
   - Transition animation on toggle

4. Enhance cookie table:
   - Improve existing table with better styling
   - Alternating row backgrounds for readability
   - Rounded corners on table container
   - Soft shadow
   - Add column for "Status" showing if cookie category is enabled
   - Mobile responsive: horizontal scroll or card layout on small screens

5. Apply warm aesthetic:
   - Soft shadows on cards
   - Rounded corners everywhere (rounded-xl)
   - Warm accents for enabled states
   - Keep warning box about blocking essential cookies

Keep all Bulgarian text exactly as-is.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` in tools-shop directory - no TypeScript errors.
Visit http://localhost:3000/cookies - verify toggles are interactive, table is well-styled.
  </verify>
  <done>
Cookies page shows 4 category cards with toggle switches, Mandatory always on, others toggleable, table shows cookie details with improved styling, warm aesthetic applied.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance /delivery page with icon grid + FAQ accordion</name>
  <files>tools-shop/src/app/delivery/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Enhance the delivery page with better icon grid and FAQ accordion:

1. Convert to client component ('use client') for accordion state

2. Improve the top icon grid (already has 3 cards):
   - Keep the 3 existing highlight cards (Free delivery, Fast delivery, Nationwide)
   - Enhance styling: larger icons, more prominent shadows
   - Add hover effect: slight lift on hover
   - Ensure rounded-xl corners, soft shadows

3. Create FAQ accordion at bottom of page:
   - Extract common delivery questions from existing content:
     * "Кога ще получа поръчката си?" (delivery times)
     * "Колко струва доставката?" (pricing)
     * "Как да проследя пратката?" (tracking)
     * "Какво да направя при неуспешна доставка?" (failed delivery)
     * "Какви методи на плащане приемате?" (payment methods)
   - Accordion behavior: one open at a time OR multiple open (Claude's discretion)
   - ChevronDown icon that rotates on expand
   - Smooth height transition
   - Answers pulled from existing page content (Bulgarian text)

4. Reorganize existing sections:
   - Courier info cards: keep but ensure consistent styling
   - Pricing table: keep but add rounded corners, soft shadow
   - Move detailed text sections above FAQ (condensed if needed)
   - FAQ at very bottom as quick reference

5. Apply warm aesthetic consistently:
   - All cards: rounded-xl, shadow-sm
   - Consistent spacing
   - Warm accent colors from brand

Import ChevronDown from lucide-react. Keep all Bulgarian text as-is.
  </action>

  </verify>
  <done>
Delivery page shows enhanced icon grid with hover effects, FAQ accordion at bottom with 5 common questions, all sections have consistent warm styling with rounded corners and soft shadows.
  </done>
