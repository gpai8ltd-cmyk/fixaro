  <name>Task 1: Enhance /returns page with timeline + comparison table + CTA</name>
  <files>tools-shop/src/app/returns/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Enhance the returns page with better visual timeline, comparison table, and prominent CTA:

1. Keep the existing 14-day highlight box at top (already well-designed)

2. Enhance the return process timeline (already has numbered steps):
   - Convert to visual timeline with connecting line
   - Vertical line on left connecting step circles
   - Each step circle: numbered, colored (primary color)
   - Step content on right of the line
   - Add icons for each step (Phone, Mail, Package, Truck, CheckCircle)
   - Subtle background cards behind each step
   - Timeline works on mobile (single column)

3. Create comparison table for return scenarios:
   - Replace the "Разходи за връщане" bullet list with a table:

   | Сценарий | Разходи | Срок |
   |----------|---------|------|
   | Отказ от договора (14 дни) | За сметка на клиента | 14 дни |
   | Дефектен продукт | За наша сметка | Гаранционен срок |
   | Грешка от наша страна | За наша сметка | 14 дни |

   - Table styling: rounded corners, soft shadow, alternating rows
   - Green highlight for "За наша сметка" rows

4. Add prominent CTA section:
   - After the process timeline, before warranty info
   - Card with warm background (amber-50 or similar)
   - Headline: "Готови да върнете продукт?"
   - Two CTA buttons side by side:
     * Primary: "Свържете се с нас" -> mailto:returns@toolsshop.bg
     * Secondary: "Обадете се" -> tel:+359888123456
   - Brief note about next steps

5. Maintain existing sections:
   - Keep "Условия за връщане" cards
   - Keep "Не подлежат на връщане" warning box
   - Keep warranty/guarantee section
   - Keep PDF download section

6. Apply warm aesthetic:
   - Rounded-xl on all cards
   - Soft shadows
   - Consistent spacing

Keep all Bulgarian text exactly as-is.

  <name>Task 2: Improve /contact page with multi-channel cards + form enhancement</name>
  <files>tools-shop/src/app/contact/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Improve the contact page with better organized channel cards and enhanced form:

1. Reorganize contact channel cards:
   - Currently in sidebar, move to top as horizontal cards
   - Create 4 distinct channel cards in a 2x2 or 4-column grid:
     * Phone: Call now CTA, hours, direct dial link
     * Email: Send email CTA, response time, mailto link
     * Address: Location, open Google Maps
     * Working hours: Weekly schedule display
   - Each card: icon, title, action button, details
   - Hover effect: lift with shadow increase
   - Rounded-xl, soft shadows

2. Enhance "Бързи въпроси" section:
   - Keep the quick action buttons
   - Style as prominent action cards
   - Maybe move above the form

3. Improve contact form:
   - Keep existing form fields and functionality
   - Improve visual styling:
     * Card container with rounded-xl, soft shadow
     * Better field spacing
     * Floating labels or clear labels above fields
     * Improved focus states on inputs
     * Success state already good, keep as-is
   - Form stays as lg:col-span-2 layout

4. Map section at bottom:
   - Keep the placeholder map section
   - Improve styling: rounded corners, better placeholder design
   - Larger "Open in Google Maps" button

5. Overall layout:
   - Channel cards at top (full width, grid)
   - Quick actions below channels
   - Form in main area
   - Map at bottom

6. Apply warm aesthetic:
   - Consistent rounded-xl
   - Soft shadows throughout
   - Warm accent colors for interactive elements

Keep all Bulgarian text exactly as-is. Keep 'use client' directive.
