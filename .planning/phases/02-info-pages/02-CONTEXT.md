# Phase 2: Info Pages - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign 6 informational pages (/terms, /privacy, /cookies, /delivery, /returns, /contact) with modern, scannable layouts. Keep all existing Bulgarian text. Each page gets layout components specified in roadmap:
- /terms: accordion + sticky TOC
- /privacy: card layout + summary box
- /cookies: category toggles + cookie table
- /delivery: icon grid + FAQ accordion
- /returns: timeline + comparison table + CTA
- /contact: multi-channel cards + improved form

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual Style
- Warm/approachable aesthetic — soft, friendly feel that makes legal text less intimidating
- Soft shadows + rounded corners on all cards and sections — modern, elevated appearance
- Use existing site's brand colors to maintain consistency

### Layout Density
- Balanced density — readable without feeling cramped or too spread out
- Medium spacing between sections, comfortable padding in cards

### Claude's Discretion
- Icon usage (decorative vs functional only)
- Page header banners vs straight-to-content
- Collapsed vs expanded default state for accordions
- Summary/TL;DR boxes for long pages
- Content width on desktop (narrow vs medium vs wide)
- Specific typography and spacing values

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches that match the warm/approachable direction with soft shadows and rounded corners.
