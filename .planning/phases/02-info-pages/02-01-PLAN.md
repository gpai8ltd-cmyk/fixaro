<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Redesign /terms page with accordion + sticky TOC</name>
  <files>tools-shop/src/app/terms/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Transform the terms page into an interactive accordion layout with sticky table of contents:

1. Convert to client component ('use client') for accordion state management
2. Add sticky TOC sidebar (left side on desktop, collapsible on mobile):
   - List all 9 sections as clickable links
   - Use anchor links (#section-1, #section-2, etc.)
   - Highlight current section (track scroll position)
   - Sticky positioning: `sticky top-24`
   - Rounded corners, soft shadow, warm background

3. Convert sections to accordion:
   - Each section expandable/collapsible
   - ChevronDown icon rotates on expand
   - Smooth height transition
   - First section expanded by default
   - Multiple sections can be open simultaneously

4. Apply warm/approachable styling:
   - Soft shadows: `shadow-sm` on cards
   - Rounded corners: `rounded-xl` on containers
   - Warm background: subtle cream/amber tints for section cards
   - Comfortable padding inside accordions
   - Keep existing Bulgarian text exactly as-is

5. Layout structure:
   - Desktop: 2-column (TOC sidebar + content)
   - Mobile: Single column with collapsible TOC at top

Import ChevronDown from lucide-react. Use useState for accordion state.

Run `npm run build` in tools-shop directory - no TypeScript errors.
Visit http://localhost:3000/terms - verify TOC links scroll to sections, accordions expand/collapse.
  </verify>
  <done>
Terms page displays sticky TOC on desktop, all 9 sections are accordions, first section expanded by default, clicking TOC links scrolls to and expands target section.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Redesign /privacy page with card layout + summary box</name>
  <files>tools-shop/src/app/privacy/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Transform the privacy page into a card-based layout with prominent summary:

1. Add TL;DR summary box at top (before sections):
   - Warm background (amber-50 or similar)
   - Rounded corners, soft shadow
   - Icon: Shield or Lock from lucide-react
   - 4-5 bullet points summarizing key privacy facts:
     * What data is collected
     * Why it's collected
     * How long it's kept
     * User rights
     * Contact for privacy questions
   - Keep summary text in Bulgarian

2. Organize sections into visual cards:
   - Each of the 10 sections becomes a card
   - Soft shadow: `shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-shadow`
   - Rounded corners: `rounded-xl`
   - Padding: `p-6`
   - Subtle border or background differentiation
   - Section number badge in corner (optional, Claude's discretion)

3. Group related sections visually:
   - Data collection (sections 1-2): grouped together
   - Processing & legal (sections 3-4): grouped
   - Your rights (sections 5-6): grouped with highlight
   - Third parties & security (sections 7-8): grouped
   - Updates & complaints (sections 9-10): grouped

4. Apply warm styling:
   - Keep the existing GDPR info box at top (already styled)
   - Warm accent colors for section headers
   - Lucide icons for each section (optional)
   - Comfortable spacing between cards

5. Layout:
   - Single column, max-width for readability
   - Cards stack vertically
   - Generous whitespace between groups

Keep existing Bulgarian text exactly as-is. This is a server component (no 'use client' needed).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` in tools-shop directory - no TypeScript errors.
Visit http://localhost:3000/privacy - verify summary box visible at top, sections displayed as cards with visual grouping.
  </verify>
  <done>
Privacy page shows TL;DR summary box with key points, all 10 sections organized in cards, related sections visually grouped, warm aesthetic with soft shadows.
  </done>
</task>
