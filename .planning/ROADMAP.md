### Phase 2: Info Pages

**Goal:** All informational pages present content in modern, scannable layouts that build customer trust.

**Success Criteria:**

### Phase 3: Animation & Polish

**Goal:** Site feels modern and responsive with smooth animations that enhance UX without causing accessibility issues.

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 (all pages ready for animation layer)

**Requirements:**
- ANIM-01: Add hover animations to buttons (scale/color transition)
- ANIM-02: Add hover animations to product cards (lift effect)
- ANIM-03: Add scroll animations to hero section (fade-in on load)
- ANIM-04: Add scroll animations to key sections (reveal on scroll)
- ANIM-05: Add page transitions (subtle fade, under 300ms)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User sees smooth hover feedback on buttons and product cards that indicates interactivity
2. User experiences subtle page load and scroll animations that draw attention to key content
3. User navigates between pages with quick transitions (under 300ms) that feel intentional
4. Users with prefers-reduced-motion enabled see static interface with no distracting motion

## Progress

| Phase | Status | Requirements | Complete |
|-------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 1 - Critical Fixes | Pending | 6 | 0/6 |
| 2 - Info Pages | Pending | 6 | 0/6 |
| 3 - Animation & Polish | Pending | 6 | 0/6 |

**Overall:** 0/18 requirements complete (0%)

## Notes

**Phase Rationale:**
- Phase 1 fixes user-facing issues that undermine trust (broken search, placeholder elements)
- Phase 2 tackles bulk content work (6 info pages) as a focused batch
- Phase 3 adds polish layer after all content/functionality is solid

**Compression Applied:**
- Quick depth setting → 3 phases instead of 4-5
- Info pages grouped together (could have been split into 2 phases at higher depth)
- Animations bundled as final polish phase
